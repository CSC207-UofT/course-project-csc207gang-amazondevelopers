#Specification

Our goal in this project is to create a marketing app whose main purpose is for users to sell products and other users 
to buy from them. The structure of the app resembles that of the Instagram app, but with different functionalities and 
where its purpose is not mainly to entertain like the Instagram app.

The app has users who can buy and sell items. A user creates a profile and users who can potentially be verified based 
on several factors such as their average star rating and their number of reviews. Users who are sellers put their item 
up for sale with pictures (and videos), as well as other specifications of their productFunctions. Buyer users who follow those 
sellers are able to see these products on their feed. Buyers are also able to look through and search for products. 
Recommendations are based on a userâ€™s shopping cart, previous searches, products they have previously bought and on the 
other users that they follow. Users are able to like, comment and post reviews on posts and are also able to directly 
message the seller for further inquiries about the productFunctions.

Buyers have a cart that they add their products to and they can purchase them from the sellers through the app. 
When users buy a productFunctions, they are prompted and given the option to get it delivered to them or they go and pick it up.

When the user starts the program, they are prompted to sign up, or sign in if they already have an account, 
once they complete this step, they are prompted to sell a productFunctions, search a productFunctions, or browse their feed which contains 
the posts from accounts that the user follows. After they see the products they searched for, or their feed, they can 
add an item from a post into their cart, and then check out.
